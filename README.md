In this repository, you'll find a comprehensive collection of code examples, projects, and assignments that cover various aspects of visual programming and related technologies. It aims to provide a valuable resource for learning, experimentation, and application of concepts taught in our Visual Lab class.

If you are a student of IUBAT and enrolled in the Visual Course, it is evident that you would require access to the class notes for this course.
